The AI engineer successfully guided the application from MVP to a production-ready state, iteratively implementing complex features based on precise user feedback. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the core order workflow, addressing critical frontend issues like component duplication in  and ensuring correct single-service and combined order processes. This involved restoring corrupted files and debugging UI logic. Subsequently, the engineer tackled significant UI/UX improvements, including rebranding, fixing header positions, and resolving display issues with long filenames in the admin panel. The latter half of the trajectory concentrated on adding advanced business logic: comprehensive user and service management for admins, payment status tracking, client debt calculation, order cancellation, and a robust notification system. File upload and status change functionalities for admins were also restored. Backend models () were extended, and the frontend (, ) was refactored extensively to accommodate these features. The process concluded with a fully functional system meeting all user requirements.

<product_requirements>
The application, DMR DEVELOPPEMENT (formerly CartoMapping), provides a file service for engine mappings. Initially focused on file upload/download (max 10MB), it evolved into a comprehensive business management system. Key requirements include:
**Core**: File upload/download.
**Business Logic**: Billing for predefined services (e.g., Stage 1: 70€, Stage 2: 90€), combined service pricing, no processing time display for clients, delivered status removed (using terminated).
**User Management**: Client signup, login, order tracking; Admin full control (create/delete/edit clients/services, access history, download files regardless of status).
**Client Features**: Select single/multiple services (cart system), detailed vehicle info form *before* file upload, upload original files with notes, track orders, download modified files.
**Admin Features**: Upload/download original and modified files (v1, v2, v3, SAV), manage clients (create, delete, revoke, edit, activate/deactivate), manage services (adjust price, create/delete/edit, activate/deactivate, make visible/invisible), full order history. New requests included order sorting by client, payment status, client total due, order cancellation with balance recalculation, client discount management (1-30%), notifications for new orders/SAV, chat system (concept), client Demande de SAV button, displaying vehicle registration with service in order recaps.
**Branding**: Renamed from CartoMapping to DMR DEVELOPPEMENT.

<pending_tasks>
All initial pending tasks mentioned at the beginning of the trajectory were addressed and completed throughout the development process. The final summary states that the application is 100% complete with all user requests implemented.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed implementing a final set of complex features to bring the application to a production-ready state, as per the user's latest detailed requests.

The work included:
1.  **Restoring and enhancing admin functionalities**:
    *   Re-implemented the ability for admins to upload modified files for orders, including version selection (v1, v2, v3, SAV).
    *   Restored and enhanced the order status dropdown, allowing admins to change order statuses to En attente, En cours, Terminé, and importantly, introduced and integrated the Annulé status.
    *   Ensured that setting an order to Annulé automatically zeroes out its balance.
    *   Made sure all admin management actions (creating/editing/deleting users and services, activating/deactivating accounts) were fully functional via modals.
2.  **Implementing a notification system for admin**:
    *   Developed backend models and API endpoints for notifications.
    *   Integrated a notification bell icon in the admin header with a real-time unread count.
    *   Configured notifications to trigger upon new client orders and client SAV requests.
3.  **Implementing client-side Demande de SAV**:
    *   Added a Demande de SAV button for clients on completed orders.
    *   Ensured this action triggers a notification for admins.
4.  **Improving order display**:
    *   Modified the order recap display for both client and admin to show the vehicle's  (registration) followed by the selected service(s) (e.g., AB-123-CD - Stage 1 + EGR). This required backend logic to extract  from client notes.
5.  **Refining client order workflow UI**:
    *   Removed explicit mentions of maximum file size (e.g., 10MB max).
    *   Changed the file already modified checkbox to a dropdown with Origine and Fichier modifié options.
6.  **Minor refinements**: The AI engineer had also ensured the DMR DEVELOPPEMENT branding was consistent and headers remained fixed during scrolling.

The last successful action was the confirmation that all these newly implemented features were fully functional across both client and admin interfaces, bringing the application to a complete and operational state.
