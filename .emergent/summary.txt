The AI engineer's work followed an iterative development approach, initially building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then progressively enhancing it based on detailed user feedback. Key challenges involved implementing a complex authentication and role-based access control system, robust file handling with MongoDB GridFS (especially managing ObjectIDs), and a dynamic service ordering and pricing mechanism. The engineer repeatedly refactored core frontend and backend components using , leading to some issues with component duplication and linting errors in . Testing was primarily done via a  and manual UI checks through screenshots. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer actively troubleshooting a series of critical bugs and workflow refinements identified by the user, particularly concerning the order placement process and frontend component management. The last action indicates a struggle with overwriting an existing file during a refactor.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a file service for engine mapping () allowing file uploads and downloads. This evolved into a comprehensive business management system, DMR Développement, with the following key requirements:

**Core Functionality:**
- File upload/download service for engine mappings.
- Maximum file size: approximately 10MB.

**Business Logic & Pricing:**
- Implement a billing system based on predefined service types with specific prices (e.g., Stage 1: 70€, Stage 2: 90€, etc., including combined services like Stage 1 + Flexfuel: 130€).
- Clients must be able to select multiple services for a single mapping file, with prices accumulating automatically.
- Processing times (délais de traitement) should not be displayed on the client interface.
- The order status delivered is redundant and should be removed, using terminated instead.

**User Management & Roles:**
- Client accounts with signup, login, historical tracking, and order follow-up.
- An administrative space with full control over the system.

**Admin Features:**
- Upload and download mapping files, including original client files and modified versions (v1, v2, v3, SAV).
- Manage clients: create, delete, revoke access, and edit client profiles.
- Manage services/prestations: adjust prices, create/delete/edit service items, activate/deactivate them.
- Access to a complete order history.
- Admin must be able to download original client files regardless of the order's status (e.g., en attente, en cours, terminé).

**Client Features:**
- Select desired services (single or multiple via a shopping cart system).
- Provide detailed vehicle information (brand, model, year, power, ECU, etc.) through a form *before* uploading the file.
- Upload original mapping files, accompanied by notes or instructions (e.g., vehicle description, desired modifications).
- Track the progress and status of their orders.
- Download the modified versions of their mapping files.

**Branding:**
- The application name CartoMapping must be rebranded to DMR Développement across all interfaces.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Application**: Built with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend API, and MongoDB as the database.
- **File Storage**: MongoDB GridFS is used for efficient storage and retrieval of large mapping files.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) secure user authentication and role-based access control (Client, Admin).
- **API Design**: All backend API routes are prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress compatibility.
- **Environment Variables**: Strict adherence to  and  from  files.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components.

**High-Level Architecture:**
The application consists of a React.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints. Files are managed using MongoDB's GridFS.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the central file for the FastAPI backend, defining all API endpoints, database interactions, authentication, user/service/order management, and GridFS file operations.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent significant revisions throughout the development. It was initially set up for basic CRUD and authentication. Subsequent updates added:
        -   GridFS integration for file storage, including specific handling for  to ensure correct file downloads.
        -   Endpoints for client notes during file upload, file versioning (original, v1, v2, v3, SAV), and admin-specific download routes.
        -   Comprehensive API endpoints for client and service management (creation, retrieval, update, deletion, activation/deactivation).
        -   Logic to support combined service orders and calculate total prices.
        -   Modification of file download logic to allow admin downloads regardless of order status.
        -   Removal of the delivered order status.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main React component, responsible for rendering the entire user interface for both clients and administrators. It manages application state, routing, and all frontend-to-backend API communications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified and rewritten in multiple iterations. Initial setup included basic authentication forms and a functional UI. Later changes incorporated:
        -   A redesigned file upload interface with a drag-and-drop area and a dedicated notes input field.
        -   Client and admin dashboards displaying orders, services, and users.
        -   UI elements for listing files, download buttons for both original and modified versions, and an admin version selector for uploads.
        -   Implementation of single and multiple service selection through a shopping cart system with dynamic price calculation.
        -   An integrated detailed vehicle information form that clients fill out before order creation.
        -   Complete rebranding from CartoMapping to DMR Développement across the UI.
        -   Removal of processing time displays from the client order interface.
        -   Refactoring of the order workflow (select services -> fill vehicle form -> upload file -> create order).
        -   Attempts to fix component duplication and ESLint errors.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include  (for password hashing) and other libraries necessary for authentication and GridFS operations.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified during the rebranding effort to change instances of CartoMapping to DMR Développement in the page title or other static text.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and fix the critical bug where selecting a Stage 2 service reverts it to Stage 1 when a single service is chosen.
- Implement the Commander maintenant button functionality for combined orders (currently does nothing).
- Correct the single-service order workflow to go from service selection to vehicle information/file upload, not directly to mes commandes.
- Resolve the UI issue in the admin panel where long original file names hide the download button.
- Finalize the backend endpoint for combined orders (marked as needing finalization).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively addressing a series of critical issues identified by the user after a comprehensive build. The core focus was on refining the client's order placement workflow.

Specifically, the AI engineer was implementing a new sequential process for client orders:
1.  Clients select their desired services (single or multiple).
2.  Clients fill out a detailed vehicle information form.
3.  Clients then upload their original mapping file.
4.  Only after these steps is a new order officially created.

To achieve this, the AI engineer was modifying  to create and integrate a new  responsible for handling the vehicle data input. Concurrent with this, adjustments were being made to the backend's API for combined orders () and the removal of the redundant delivered order status.

The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer attempting to recreate the file cleanly with the correct structure for  to resolve internal component duplication and ESLint parsing errors that arose during the refactoring process. However, this attempt failed because the  command was used on an existing file, which is not permitted for overwriting, indicating a slight misstep in file manipulation strategy.

<optional_next_step>
Resolve the  command failure for  and continue debugging the new order workflow, specifically the Commander maintenant button and single-service redirection logic.
